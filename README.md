Swift Fundamentals III  

In this set of exercises, we'll be adding to our knowledge of the basic building blocks by incorporating Arrays.  

Complete the following exercises in a playground and upload your code below.  

1. Write a program that adds the numbers 1-255 to an array  
2. Swap two random values in the array  
Hint: you can use the arc4random_uniform(UInt32) function to get a random number from 0 to the number passed in. The arc4random_uniform function takes in one parameter that is of the UInt32 type and returns a random number that is of the UInt32 type. How can you deal with this using your knowledge of types?
3. Now write the code that swaps random values 100 times (You've created a "Shuffle"!)  
4. Remove the value "42" from the array and Print "We found the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything at index __" and print the index of where "42" was before you removed it.
